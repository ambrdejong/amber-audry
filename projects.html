      <p>Questions, Memory, Tree uses windows as a medium of story telling. A window exists between the in and outside, offering a glimpse out as well as inside. The reflection in the window challenges this, giving us a clue about what is going on on either side.
      Combined with text the video explores uncertainties and that what is unknown to us. </p>

        is only amplified by the long low lit entrance that precedes it.</p>
